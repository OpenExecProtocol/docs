# Health Check

An OXP server MUST implement a health check endpoint that returns a 200 OK response if the server is healthy.

## Flow Details

**Request:**

- **Method:** GET
- **Endpoint:** `/health`
- **Security:** No authentication is required.
- **Headers:**
  - `OXP-Version` (optional, string): The [version](../versioning) of OXP that the client supports. If not provided, the server MAY assume the client supports the latest version of OXP.

**Response:**

- **Status Code:** 200 OK
- **Headers:**
  - `OXP-Version` (string): The [version](../versioning) of OXP used by the server.

If the server is ready to receive tool calls, the server MUST return a 200 OK response. The server MAY return an HTTP 503 response if it is not ready to receive tool calls.

## Non-Normative Example

The following example is provided to illustrate the use of the health check endpoint:

**Request**

```http
GET /health HTTP/1.1
```

**Response**

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
OXP-Version: 1.0
```
