# Versioning

The Open eXecution Protocol defines a versioning mechanism for the protocol messages exchanged between clients and tool servers.

## Schema Versioning

The [OpenAPI schema](https://github.com/OpenToolCalling/Specification/tree/main/spec/http/1.0/openapi.json) is versioned using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

1. Changes that break backward compatibility MUST be versioned as a new major version.
2. Changes that add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner MUST be versioned as a new minor version.

## Protocol Message Versioning

The `OXP-Version` header is used in requests and responses to indicate the version of OXP that the client supports. The header value MUST be a valid semantic version. For example:

```http
OXP-Version: 1.0
```

If the `OXP-Version` header is not included, the server MAY assume the client supports the latest version of OXP supported by the server.
