# Tool Secrets

Tool secrets are sensitive values that are required to call a tool, such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials.

Tools MAY require secrets, as specified in the `requirements.secrets` field of the Tool Definition schema.

When a tool requires secrets, the client MUST retrieve the secrets (itself or via a trusted intermediary) and provide them in the [Call Tool Request](../schemas/call-tool-request), before calling the tool.

If the client does not provide a secret in the Call Tool Request for a tool that requires a secret, the server MUST return a 400 Bad Request response as described in the [Call Tool (Server Errors)](../protocol/call-tool#server-errors) section.

    U->>C: Input: "Send an SMS to +15556051234567"<br/>user_id: bob@example.com
    Note over C: Tool SMS.Send has a secret requirement:<br/>id: TWILIO_API_KEY
    C-->>SM: Get secret TWILIO_API_KEY
    SM-->>C: TWILIO_API_KEY=abc123...
    C->>S: Call tool SMS.Send with TWILIO_API_KEY=abc123...
    S->>T: Run tool (function)
    T->>S: Return tool response
    S->>C: Return tool response
