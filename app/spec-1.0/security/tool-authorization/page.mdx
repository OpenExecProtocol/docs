# Tool Authorization

Tool authorization describes how the server authorizes the tool call: given a tool's definition, whether the client needs to authorize the user before calling the tool.

Tools MAY require token-based or other forms of authorization, as specified in the `requirements.authorization` field of the [Tool Definition schema](../schemas/tool-definition).

If the `requirements` field is NOT present, the server MUST allow the tool to be executed without passing any additional information.

When a given tool describes authorization requirements in the `requirements.authorization` field, the client MUST resolve (or delegate to a trusted intermediary) the authorization requirements and provide the necessary credentials (e.g. a token) in the [Call Tool Request](../schemas/call-tool-request), before calling the tool.

If the client does not provide a valid token in the Call Tool Request for a tool that requires authorization, the server MUST return a 400 Bad Request response as described in the [Call Tool (Server Errors)](../protocol/call-tool#server-errors) section.

    participant U as User
    participant C as Client
    participant AS as Authorization Server
    participant S as Tool Server
    participant T as Tool

    U->>C: Input: "Read my recent emails"<br/>user_id: bob@example.com
    Note over C: Tool Gmail.GetEmails has an authorization requirement:<br/>id: google<br/>scopes: [https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly]
    C-->>AS: OAuth 2.0 request
    AS-->>C: Scoped token for user
    C->>S: Call tool Gmail.GetEmails with token
    S->>T: Run tool (function)
    T->>S: Return tool response
    S->>C: Return tool response
