# Introduction

The Open Tool Calling (OTC) standard establishes a set of protocols and formats to facilitate communication between agents (clients) and tools (functions or services) in distributed systems. It ensures that tool definitions, requests, and responses adhere to a structured and open standard.

This document defines the structures and protocols used to describe tools, initiate tool calls, and process responses. The standard consists of a set of JSON schemas that govern tool definitions, tool requests, and tool responses as described in the [OpenAPI spec](https://spec.openapis.org/registry-metadata/openapi-extensions). It aims to provide a unified, extensible, and interoperable framework for client-to-tool interactions.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/bcp14) [[RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)] [[RFC8174](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174)] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Terminology

- **Agent**: An entity that issues requests to tools for performing specific tasks.
- **Tool Server**: An entity that hosts a collection of tools and processes tool calls.
- **Tool**: A service or function that can be invoked by an agent using the defined protocols.
