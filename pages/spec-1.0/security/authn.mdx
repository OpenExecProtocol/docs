# Server Authentication

Server authentication describes how the server authenticates the client: which clients are allowed to make OTC requests to the Tool Server.

Servers that are internet-facing SHOULD require authentication.

## Authentication Methods

### No Authentication

If a server is configured to not require authentication, the server MUST ignore the `Authorization` header.

### API Key Authentication

A static API key is a simple shared secret that both the client and server know. This method provides simple authentication with minimal implementation complexity.

Requirements:

- The client MUST include the API key in the `OTC-API-Key` HTTP header with each request.
- Servers that support this authentication method MUST validate the API key against their stored value.
- Clients and servers MUST transmit API keys only over secure connections (HTTPS).
- Servers MUST reject requests with missing or invalid API keys with a 401 Unauthorized HTTP response.
- API keys SHOULD be generated with sufficient entropy (recommended minimum 32 bytes) and SHOULD be treated as sensitive information.

#### Non-Normative Example: API Key

```http
GET /tools HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
OTC-API-Key: ahf62jd81hdk19akqnd62hdka
```

### JWT Bearer Token Authentication

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as described in [RFC 7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519) provide a more secure authentication mechanism that doesn't require sending the shared secret with each request.

Requirements:

- The client MUST include a valid JWT in the `Authorization` HTTP header using the Bearer scheme.
- The client MUST sign the JWT using the shared secret key using the HS256 algorithm.
- The server MUST validate the JWT signature using the shared secret key.
- The JWT MUST include the `exp` claim, which SHOULD be no more than 15 minutes in the future.
- Servers MUST reject requests with missing, invalid, or expired JWTs with a 401 Unauthorized HTTP response.
- The JWT MAY include the `aud` claim. If the `aud` claim is present, the server MUST validate it against the server's allowed client list.
- Servers SHOULD enforce a reasonably short expiration time for JWTs to limit potential damage from token exposure.

#### Non-Normative Example: JWT Bearer Token

```http
GET /tools HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJvdGNzZXJ2ZXIiLCJleHAiOjE3NDE3MjQyMTl9.FPIFSSUmngbyePKghI54zUJ-dUxCrh4ZnP9TId5zk34
```

## Selecting an Authentication Method

Servers MUST document which authentication methods they support. Servers MAY support multiple authentication methods simultaneously.

Clients SHOULD prefer JWT Bearer token authentication over static API key authentication when both are available, due to its enhanced security properties.

For highly sensitive operations or production environments, servers SHOULD consider implementing additional security measures beyond these basic authentication methods, such as IP allowlisting, rate limiting, or more sophisticated authentication protocols.
